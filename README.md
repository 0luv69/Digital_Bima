Digital Bima: Streamlining Healthcare Appointments in Nepal
Digital Bima is a web application built with Django (backend framework) and Tailwind CSS (front-end framework) that aims to address common inefficiencies within the Nepalese hospital system, specifically focusing on streamlining the Outpatient Department (OPD) process.

Problems Addressed:

Lengthy Wait Times: Patients often face long lines for three separate stages: OPD paper processing, doctor checkups, and finally, medication collection.
Lack of Online Appointments: The current system lacks an online appointment booking mechanism, leading to in-person queues and wasted time.
Solutions Offered:

Simplified Appointment Booking: Users can register and sign in to the platform. Once logged in, they can book appointments in a single click by selecting their preferred hospital, doctor's specialization (e.g., physician, psychologist, dentist), and desired date/time.
Appointment Management: The platform displays a user's current appointments, providing details such as the hospital, doctor's specialization, assigned token number, estimated wait times for checkups and medication collection. This allows users to plan their visits effectively.
Appointment History: The "Recent Appointments" section provides a record of past appointments, including the date, time, total cost of purchased medications (when applicable), and a breakdown of prescribed medications, doctor's reports, and details of the visited hospital and doctor's specialization (accessible via a dropdown menu).
Overall Benefits:

Digital Bima empowers patients in Nepal to manage their healthcare appointments efficiently. By eliminating unnecessary queues and providing clear appointment information, the platform saves valuable time and enhances the overall healthcare experience.
